This is a test repository that shows how I'm connecting to a mongo database.
I'm seeing a performance problem when connecting to a database.
The very first call made after Connect is slow.
The second call is always MUCH faster.

Is there a way to speed up the first call?
I'm seeing this both connecting to a local mongo instance running in Docker or connecting to CosmosDB.
